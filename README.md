The app utilizes the powerful <b>[Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api)</b> to fetch real-time weather data and provide a 7-week weather forecast. By leveraging Expo SDK 41, the app ensures optimal performance and seamless compatibility across platforms.

To bring the app to life, we've incorporated two animation libraries:

- **Moti**: Moti simplifies the creation and management of captivating animations, adding fluid motion and interactivity to the user experience.
- **Lottie**: Lottie allows seamless integration of beautiful animations created in After Effects or other animation tools into the app, enhancing visual appeal.
